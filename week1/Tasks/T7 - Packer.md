# Using packer automate the entire setup.

Here is the Packer File:- https://github.com/mehul-anshumali/Internship_PhonePe/tree/main/week1/packer

Run packer build:

```
packer build ubuntu-20.04-live-server-packer.json
```
VM OS automated properly, but packer is not logged in to the system automatically, I have to manually type the account username and password. 

**_Still Figuring out How to automate. the log in process._**
